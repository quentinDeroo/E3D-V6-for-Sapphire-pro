# E3D V6 for Sapphire Pro

This is a kit to adapt and E3D V6 or E3D Volcano hotend to a Sapphire Pro. I also updated the part cooling fans so that it actually blows air.
I tried to keep it as simple as possible and to use as many stock parts and solutions as I could. That's why there are only 2 different parts in this kit (one of which you will need to print twice).

Here is the list of non-printed parts you will need :
- An E3D V6, obviously
- 2x 4020 radial fans (I used Winsinn fans from amazon but I believe they are all basically the same)
- 6x M3x16mm screws
- That's it

I printed all the parts at 0.15mm layer height, with support for the fan shroud and without for the hotend adapter. Make sure to print the latest standing (top down) so it will be able to flex to attach the hotend.



The biggest possible improvement would be to design a new sheet metal bracket that screws on both sides of the linear rail bracket, and leaves more open air for the hotend fan.
